## Hi, you can call me Ji.

I'm sitting around with some kinds of dev stuff like web apps and APIs to game dev and mobile apps, even bothering to create some crazy-ass UI and graphics engines. I know, bruh, I'm far away from the best of the genius dudes. Still needa see how shit's working, and however it's working whenever I make something.
